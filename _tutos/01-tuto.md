Minimal Mistakes has been developed as a [Jekyll theme gem](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) for easier use. It is also 100% compatible with GitHub Pages --- just with slightly different installation process.

## Installing the Theme

If you're running Jekyll v3.5+ and self-hosting you can quickly install the theme as a Ruby gem.

[^structure]: See [**Structure** page]({{ "/docs/structure/" | relative_url }}) for a list of theme files and what they do.

**ProTip:** Be sure to remove `/docs` and `/test` if you forked Minimal Mistakes. These folders contain documentation and test pages for the theme and you probably don't want them littering up your repo.
