## Compile Spider library with PThread

**Note**: For CodeBlocks users **only**: make sure you do not use the version of MinGW provided with CodeBlocks installer (4.9.2) as it ships with its own outdated, incompatible version of PThread. Please install the latest version (5.3.0+) from the [MinGW website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/).

1.  Go on [Spider GitHub page](https://github.com/preesm/spider.git), choose the **master** branch and download the source code: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/preesm/spider.git
cd spider/
```
2.  Inside the "/master/" directory, use the CMake script corresponding to your IDE/compiler and compile the library.  
    **Note**: If you are using Windows, follow the instruction given in 
    ```/master/libspider/lib/ReadMe.md``` before compiling Spider. Also please use [PThread 2.10.0](/assets/downloads/pthread-2.10.0.zip).
3.  Copy "spider.h" from 
    ```/master/libspider/spider/``` to 
    ```/<project>/Code/lib/spider/include/```
4.  Copy the library file(s) from the output directory to 
    ```/\<project\>/Code/lib/spider/lib/```
    *   with **GCC**: libSpider.so
    *   with **Visual**: Spider.dll and Spider.lib
    *   with **CodeBlocks**: libSpider.dll and libSpider.dll.a

## Troubleshooting

*  If you encounter issues with Spider, please create an issue on the [Spider issues tracker](https://github.com/preesm/spider/issues).
*  If you encounter an issue when executing an application on top of Spider:
  * The release cycles of Preesm and Spider are not synchronized, hence causing incompatibilities between code generated by Preesm and the Spider runtime library. This can be mitigated by using develop version.
