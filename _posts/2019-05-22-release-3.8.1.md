We have released Preesm version 3.8.1. The main change consist in the renaming of the global variable that controls how the application exits. This variable used to be **stopThreads** and is now prefixed with **preesm** to give **preesmStopThreads**. This update requires the user applications to reflect this change. To have an idea of the impact, you can have a look at our [updated application repository](https://github.com/preesm/preesm-apps/commit/8ee2fff130f686128f44e4d535ab772b93ecc0ee).
