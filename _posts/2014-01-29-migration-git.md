The Preesm team recently moved from SVN to git and from Sourceforge to Github. Our projects are visible on [our Github page](https://github.com/preesm). Issues can be notified on the issues pages of the differents repositories ([Preesm issues](https://github.com/preesm/preesm/issues), [DFTools issues](https://github.com/preesm/dftools/issues), [Graphiti issues](https://github.com/preesm/graphiti/issues)).

We also released version 1.0.0 of Preesm, which notably correct a bug about hierarchical actors.
