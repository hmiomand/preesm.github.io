You are working both with Preesm and the [SDF For Free (SDF3)](http://www.es.ele.tue.nl/sdf3/) framework and you are tired of modeling your applications in both tools; we have a solution for you. It is now possible to convert SDF Graphs from the SDF3 format to Preesm, and vice-versa. To do so, simply follow our [SDF3 tutorial](http://preesm.insa-rennes.fr/website/index.php?id=import-export-an-sdf3-graph).
