We have released Preesm version 3.6.2. This release changes how the Code Generation macros work.

<!--more-->

In previous versions, the code generation was making use of 2 macros, **VERBOSE** and **LOOP_SIZE**. To avoid possible conflicts with application constants, we have prefixed them with **PREESM_**. This requires manual change in the **preesm.h** header.

Also, the [task reference for the code generation](/docs/workflowtasksref/#code-generation-1) now display properly the effect of these macros.
