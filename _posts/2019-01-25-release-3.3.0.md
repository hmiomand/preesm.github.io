We have released Preesm version 3.3.0, introducing 2 parameters for controling workflows.

<!--more-->

The workflow parameters control the workflow output and behavior as follows:
 * 'Error on Warning': If set to 'true' (default), the workflow will stop with failure when the log prints a warning or severe entry;
 * 'Verbose Level': Controls the output of the log. Default value is INFO. Possible values range in ```{ALL, FINEST, FINER, FINE, CONFIG, INFO, WARNING, SEVERE, NONE}```, as defined in [```java.util.logging.Level```](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/logging/Level.html).

Note that, as the error on warning parameter is set to 'true' by default, this may change the behavior of existing workflows throwing warnings.
