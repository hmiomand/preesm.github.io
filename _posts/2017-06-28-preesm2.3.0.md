We released new versions for Preesm (2.3.0), DFTools (1.2.0) and Graphiti (1.4.0). The major changes lie in the build process:

*   Products are uploaded on [Github](https://github.com/preesm/preesm/releases)
*   New Eclipse features (source code and developer features) in the [update site](http://preesm.insa-rennes.fr/repo/complete/)
*   Graphiti, DFTools and Preesm now live independently (you do not need the source code of Graphiti to compile DFTools, etc.)
*   First version of the test API for automated tests
*   Details available in [release notes](https://github.com/preesm/preesm/blob/880e3fe6b7d386c179f5c6d62bc768ec54f00db8/release_notes.md)

Note that you will need to update your Eclipse with the Developer Requirements (Meta Feature) in order to build Preesm from source (see updated [Building Preesm](/docs/buildpreesm/) page).
