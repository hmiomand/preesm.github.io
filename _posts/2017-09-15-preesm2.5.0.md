This version introduces a new code generator. It now generates the **main.c** file while taking into account the number of processors of the target architecture. Consquently, there is no need to edit the CMake file anymore. That is, there is no need to change from **set(CMAKE\_C\_FLAGS "-DX1_CORE")** to **set(CMAKE\_C\_FLAGS "-DX4_CORES")**. Tutorial materials have been updated in order to respect this new behavior.
