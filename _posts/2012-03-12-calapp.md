Applications described with [CAL Actor Language (CAL)](http://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/caltrop/language.html) can now be imported into Preesm through the [Open-RVC-CAL Compiler (Orcc)](http://orcc.sourceforge.net/). To do so, applications are compiled using the "Embedded C" backend of Orcc. This compilation process takes as inputs the CAL description of the actors and a network of instances of these actors. This compilation process produces a C source code file for each actor and an algorithm graph equivalent to the input network.  
Only applications with a Synchronous Data-Flow behavior will pass the compilation process. An example of application is available [here](http://orc-apps.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/orc-apps/trunk/Research/src/org/ietr/transformer/sdf/).
