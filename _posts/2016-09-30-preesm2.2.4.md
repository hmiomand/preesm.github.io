We just released version 2.2.4 of PREESM, and version 1.1.8 of DFTools. You can find these new versions on our update site: [http://preesm.sourceforge.net/eclipse/update-site/](http://preesm.sourceforge.net/eclipse/update-site/).

Please note that you will need to update your code generation workflows when using the new version. Ports of workflow tasks responsible for Memory Allocation and Code Generation were updated. `MEGs` replaces `MemEx` for Memory Allocation output port and Code Generation input port. Alternatively, you can also download an updated workflow from the tutorials, or on [GitHub](https://github.com/preesm/preesm-apps/tree/master/org.ietr.preesm.pisdf.library).

### New features

*   New support for distributed memory architectures during memory allocation and code generation. (cf. Memory allocation task [documentation](http://preesm.insa-rennes.fr/website/index.php?id=documentation)).
*   New workflow tasks [documentation](http://preesm.insa-rennes.fr/website/index.php?id=documentation) describing purpose, inputs/outputs, parameters, and errors of tasks.
*   `C` and `InstrumentedC` code generation supports following new processing elements types: `ARM`, `GPP`, `ARM_CortexA7`, `ARM_CortexA15`.
*   Generated C code supports finite number of graph iteration.
*   New systematic simplification of Fork-Join and Join-Fork patterns during single-rate transformation.

Detailed changes and bug fixes for this new version is available [in the changelog](https://github.com/preesm/preesm/blob/master/release_notes.md).
