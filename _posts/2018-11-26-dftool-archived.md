We have setup an update site for hosting the last 10 snapshot versions of Preesm at [https://preesm.github.io/preesm-snapshot-site/](https://preesm.github.io/preesm-snapshot-site/).

The procedure is similar to the one presented in our [documentation](/get/#eclipse-update-site).

Also, following the release 3.0.0, the DFTools repository has been archived. That means the repository is now read-only and we stop its support. All the releases are still available on our archived repository at [http://preesm.insa-rennes.fr/repo/update-site-backups/](http://preesm.insa-rennes.fr/repo/update-site-backups/).
