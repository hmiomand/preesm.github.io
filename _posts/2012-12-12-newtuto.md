A new tutorial explaining how to create your own workflow tasks is now available in the [Developer page](http://preesm.insa-rennes.fr/website/index.php?id=developer). This tutorial is a step-by-step guide that covers both the creation of a new Eclipse plugin and the creation, the configuration, and the implementation of a new workflow task. The tutorial can be found [here](http://preesm.insa-rennes.fr/website/index.php?id=new-workflow-task).
