We have released Preesm version 3.15.0. Starting with this release, the workflow executor now throws warning when executing a task marked as deprecated. If the property "Error on warnings" is set to true (see [this post](/release-3.3.0/)), existing workflows will have a different behavior. Full list of changes is available in the [release notes](https://github.com/preesm/preesm/blob/v3.15.0/release_notes.md). This new version also come with Spider codegen updates, requiring the update of the [Spider runtime to 1.5.0](https://github.com/preesm/spider/releases/tag/v1.5.0).
